create_post.ejs
-> Make sure that inputs are filled before allowing to list
-> Make sure that terms and conditions are agreeded to before listing

messages.ejs and chat.ejs
-> Two separated places for looking at messages
-> messages will be used for finding the active chats that someone has (helps with the Spacing
on mobile sense the screen size is not that large, active containers all around make it hard to navigate)
-> messages will have cards pointing to different chat rooms (maybe make refs or something to each room with sockets?)
-> chat room will be simple and just dedicated to sending and receiving messages from one person, rather than
looking at open messages as well
-> Need to make sure that the messages that are being displayed to the user are the ones that they have made to a user,
and not something that someone else has made
-> new chat sessions can only be made with the button on a listing rather than in the chat room to hopefully
stop users from making random ones

Ideas for messages and chat:
-> Add placeholders for rest of cards when the number of known chat rooms is not a multple of 2
-> When a message is opened up, its new status needs to be set back to false again
